# Marky Markov and the Chainy Bunch

This is a project that I am doing to create board game themed words and phrases using a BoardGameGeek corpus. Project is built with python and a MariaDB database storing all the source data 

# Database Setup

The [database initialization scipt](/database/database.sql) will create the tables, view and stored procedures that I use to store and query boardgame data and various n-grams
